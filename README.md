🚗 Car Price Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts the selling price of a car based on its features such as year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more. This model can assist individuals and dealerships in estimating fair market prices for used cars.

📌 Project Overview

This project aims to build a regression model that predicts the price of a car using supervised learning techniques. We use a cleaned dataset, apply preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and train several regression models to find the best-performing one.

🔍 Features

Handles missing values and outliers.

Performs exploratory data analysis with visualizations.

Implements feature encoding and scaling.

Trains multiple regression models:

Linear Regression

Ridge & Lasso Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Evaluates models using metrics like MAE, MSE, and R² score.

Predicts car prices based on input features.

(Optional) Includes a web interface using Streamlit or Flask for user interaction.

go to the url http://127.0.0.1:5000
it will open a window like <br><br>

enter url then internally it will go to machune learning model and then it test the url that given url is phishing domain or not
